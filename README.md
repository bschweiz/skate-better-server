# S.K.A.T.E. Better REST API in Python built with Django

## PROBLEM SOLVED
This application will help skateboarders log and track their trick performance within personal Games of S.K.A.T.E.

S.K.A.T.E. is just like the basketball game of H.O.R.S.E. but with skateboard tricks instead of basketball shots. This app will allow the user to record each trick of a game of skate and whether or not they gained, lost, or maintained points on it. Afterwards the user can go back and review previous games to see which tricks they are losing on so that they can practice better and hopefully eventually S.K.A.T.E. Better!
